The Orchestra Earned Media Diagnostic System
Updated Overview as of v1.9 (August 2025)
________________


Executive Summary: Built for Automation. Calibrated for Humans.
The rise of AI has opened the door to a new kind of analysis — one that is far more rigorous than a human could produce, but still intuitively understandable to a human reader. This diagnostic system is designed specifically for that moment.
Traditional media analysis asks people to label coverage manually, a slow, subjective, and often inconsistent process. But the logic of earned visibility is too complex, too contextual, and too fast-moving for that approach to scale. The only way to produce consistent, high-quality analysis across hundreds or thousands of stories is to automate it.
This system does exactly that.
It’s built with tight, rule-based logic that allows an AI to evaluate every article, detect every narrative pattern, and apply the right strategic classification — every time, without drift or fatigue.
But automation alone isn’t enough. If the output isn’t interpretable, it’s not helpful. That’s why this system is also built for plain language. Everything the system can detect — dozens of different states and signals— is rendered in terms any strategist or account executive can understand:
“ZoomoGo is boxed out of the narrative but gaining traction.”
“WattHive is present in a dominant narrative but not being quoted — a clear missed opportunity.”
You don’t have to learn how the system works to benefit from it. You just need to be able to read the diagnosis and act on it.
And that’s all you need to know. If you want to understand how the system works, read on, there’s lots of detail. If you just want to see some sample reports — and determine for yourself whether it’s easy to use — click on some of the links below.

🧠 About the System
This system transforms media coverage into structured data, and then uses that data to perform a rigorous analysis. It works by building data sets containing articles determined to be at least marginally about a topic. And then for every article in a data set, it determines the prominence of and sentiment towards the overall topic, each tested narrative and each tested entity. Together, these data points make possible a broad range of strategic interpretations.
Here’s a quick glossary of terms:
Sector. E.g. tech or public affairs. These aren’t measured, but topical data sets are tagged with every sector they are relevant to. 
Topic. E.g. AI, Online safety, New York real estate. This is the universe of what matters to our clients. The system is flexible enough to allow big, broad topics and small, narrow ones. 
Narratives. E.g. economic impact of AI, technological advancements of AI. These are the storylines that drive coverage. They could be considered subtopics and the system is meant to be flexible enough to allow for separate studies where a narrative is the topic. 
Entities. These are the people, organizations and companies whose media presence we want to track. 
Here’s an example taxonomy:
Sector: Tech
Topic: AI
Narratives: Economic impact, ethics, technology advancement, regulation
Entities: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft
The system uses the assigned prominence and sentiment scores, along with the outlet an article was published in, and, for every article individually and collectively at the data-set level helps you understand how an entity is being positioned, framed, and perceived in the broader context of the narratives and topics it cares about. 
At the core, the system answers four questions:
1. Presence: Is the entity showing up at all?

2. Framing: How is the entity being portrayed — central player or passive mention? Positive or critical?

3. Trajectory: Is the framing improving, deteriorating, or stuck?

4. Strategic Condition: What is the overall reputation posture — rising leader, embattled target, narrative bystander?
It does this through a structured, multistep process. First, it determines the visibility and tone of the topic and any narratives it contains. Then it evaluates each entity’s presence and framing, assigning a state and modifier. Next, it adds signals that reveal structural context or emerging risks. Finally, it identifies broader patterns — like trajectory, sentiment shifts, or peer dynamics — to assign strategic conditions that summarize the brand’s media position.
📘 Diagnostic System Glossary


You’ve probably figured out by now that the system relies on precision and utilizes a jargon-y vocabulary in order to achieve it. While the output is plain language, getting there requires consistent terminology. Here’s a glossary of the terms you’ll see in this document. 
Term
	Definition
	Topic
	The overarching subject that defines the scope of the media conversation (e.g., “Online Safety,” “AI Regulation”). Each diagnostic data set is scoped to a single topic.
	Narrative
	A recurring storyline or sub-theme within the topic (e.g., “Parental Controls,” “Youth Mental Health”). Narratives shape how the topic is framed and can vary in prominence, sentiment, and ownership.
	Entity
	A brand, organization, company, or public figure being tracked in the analysis. The system evaluates each entity’s presence and strategic role in topic and narrative coverage.
	State
	A categorical label assigned to each topic, narrative and entity in each article, based on its visibility, sentiment, and narrative role. 
	Modifier
	A first-pass interpretation applied to every entity-state pairing. It clarifies the type of presence — such as whether coverage was positive, negative, shallow, vague, or strategic. One modifier is assigned per article-entity pair.
	Signal
	A contextual enhancer. Signals provide additional strategic insight, such as whether a story is gaining momentum, media-driven, shaping the narrative, or signaling reputational risk. Multiple signals may apply per article.
	Condition
	A strategic diagnosis assigned at the entity level based on patterns in state, modifier, and signal data. Conditions synthesize signals across time and narratives to describe an entity’s current media reality (e.g., “Emerging Villain,” “Strategic Void,” “Reputational Strength”).
	Prominence
	A 0–5 score measuring how central an entity, topic, or narrative is within a given article. A score of 0 means a narrative or entity isn’t present. A higher score indicates greater visibility and importance.
	Sentiment
	A –4 to +4 score assessing the emotional tone or evaluative framing of an entity, topic, or narrative in the article. (For technical reasons, 0 is not a valid score.)
	Quality Score
	A calculated metric combining prominence, sentiment, and outlet score to assess the strength and strategic value of coverage. Applied at the entity, topic, and narrative level.
	Outlet Score
	A numeric scale (1–5) reflecting the tier of the publication, with higher scores representing higher editorial influence or prestige. Articles >1,200 words get +1 bonus point.
	



📌 Understanding Topics and Narratives in the Diagnostic Framework
Topics are the structural anchor of this system. Each dataset begins with a defined topic such as AI, online safety, or storage technology which determines what media coverage is included for analysis. Topics set the thematic boundaries of the conversation. They do not shape how stories are told — they define what universe of stories is being examined.
This system applies a diagnostic layer to assess whether the topic itself is being treated as relevant and coherent within the media, or whether it is fading, fractured, or confined to niche domains.
🔍 Why the System Evaluates Topics
Assessing the topic allows us to determine whether the coverage environment is strategically viable. We ask:
   * Is the topic actively and centrally covered?

   * Is it framed positively or negatively?

   * Is attention increasing, stable, or declining?
These questions are answered using three primary metrics:
      * Prominence — How central the topic is within each article

      * Sentiment — The tone of that coverage

      * Volume over time — The trajectory of media attention
These signals are essential for planning. A topic that is well-framed, central to coverage, and gaining momentum may be a productive space for messaging and visibility. A topic that is rarely central, increasingly negative, or fading may no longer justify strategic focus — or may need reframing through stronger narrative leadership.
Why narratives matter
Narratives are where strategy happens.
Topics define what the media is covering — narratives define how. They shape the terms of debate, frame reputations, and create opportunities (or risks) for leadership. You don’t win topics. You win narratives.
This system applies a dedicated diagnostic layer to assess both the health and trajectory of each narrative. The goal is to understand how media is framing the topic — and what strategic moves are possible.
🔍 What the System Measures
The system evaluates each narrative on two levels:
Layer
	What It Measures
	Why It Matters
	Narrative State
	Is the narrative central to coverage? Is it framed positively or negatively?
	Reveals the strategic viability of the frame.
	Narrative Signals
	Is the narrative gaining or losing momentum? Who controls it? Is the framing fractured or consistent?
	Shows how to act — move in, back off, or reframe.
	💡 The absence of a narrative is not a data gap — it’s a strategic signal. It may suggest white space, fatigue, or framing failure.
🧱 How the System Works
Each topic and narrative receives:
         * One state, a mutually exclusive classification that reflects its strategic framing based on average sentiment and prominence across the data set.

         * Zero or more topic signals, which add context about momentum, scale, or positioning. These are stackable and describe directional or structural dynamics.
Examples:
            * A topic state might be classified as Peripheral with directional signals like Growing and Fragmented Framing.

            * A topic state might be flagged as Ambient Risk if it is low in prominence but consistently negative in tone.

            * A narrative that is well-framed, central, and gaining attention might receive the Healthy state and a Growing momentum signal.
Topic and Narrative States
Name
	Trigger logic
	Strategic meaning
	High Risk
	Prom ≥ 2.5 AND Sent < −2.0
	Highly negative and highly visible — presence may be a liability.
	Risky
	Prom ≥ 2.5 AND 0 > Sent ≥ -2
	Visible but negatively framed — reputational friction.
	Healthy
	Prom ≥ 2.5 AND Sent ≥ 0
	Central and positively framed — viable space for leadership.
	Peripheral
	0 < Prom < 2.5 AND Sent ≥ 0
	Present but niche — ambient/background visibility.
	Ambient Risk
	0 < Prom < 2.5 AND Sent < 0
	Not dominant but consistently negative — reputational drift may be going unnoticed.
	Absent
	Prom = 0
	A topic or narrative is absent

Narrative Signals
Narrative signals and conditions are handled in detail in Appendix A. They provide a parallel diagnostic ladder for evaluating the structural health of story frames, independent of entity positioning.”

Understanding Entity Positioning in the Diagnostic Framework
While topics define the field of conversation, and narratives shape its structure, entities are where strategy comes into focus. The entity evaluation system is the core of this diagnostic model — built to answer not just how often a person or a brand is mentioned, but what kind of role it plays in coverage.
“Are you leading the story, reacting to it, or missing from it altogether?”
To answer that, the system applies a three-step logic model to every article-entity pair:


🧩 Step 1: Assign a Strategic State (Pass 1)
Each brand’s appearance is first categorized into one of five mutually exclusive diagnostic states, based on its visibility, prominence, and sentiment, as well as the presence and structure of the narrative in which it appears:
State
	Trigger (per article)
	Strategic meaning
	Absent
	Topic present; entity Prom = 0; all tracked narratives Prom = 0
	The conversation is on‑topic, but outside your frames — structural alignment check. Absent helps us assess the vitality and trajectory of the topic and its narratives — and to determine whether the entity’s absence is strategically justified, benign, or in need of correction.
	Off‑Stage
	Topic present; ≥1 tracked narrative Prom > 0; entity Prom = 0
	A live frame is running without you — missed or excluded presence. Off-stage helps us evaluate how others are shaping active narratives — and to identify whether the brand is being strategically excluded, overlooked, or missing a lane to re-enter.


	Supporting Player
	Topic present; entity Prom > 0 and < 3; Sent > 0 (narrative may be present or not)
	Positive but peripheral — useful visibility, not shaping the frame. Supporting player helps us diagnose how the brand is showing up — and identify how to increase centrality and message clarity in coverage.
	Under Fire
	Topic present; entity Prom > 0; Sent < 0 (narrative may be present or not)
	Negative framing — reputational pressure. Under fire helps us identify the sources and structures of negative framing — and determine whether the brand needs to reframe the narrative, redirect attention, or correct strategic messaging.
	Leader
	Topic present; entity Prom ≥ 3; Sent > 0 (narrative may be present or not)
	Central, positive, in control — leadership moment. Leader helps us secure strategic control of high-quality coverage — and determine how to expand, replicate, or protect leadership visibility.
	Importantly, these states are not assigned in isolation. They are informed by the narrative structure of the article. In other words, narratives anchor the strategic logic and help determine whether an entity’s absence is notable, and whether its presence is influential.
These context signals help determine how much the brand’s absence or presence matters in the article — and whether it is benign, recoverable, or strategically dangerous. To interpret these dynamics, the system applies two layers of framing insight: modifiers and signals.
🧩 Step 2: Apply Modifiers and Signals
Once the state is determined, the system adds interpretive detail through two levels of diagnostic labeling:
               * Modifiers — one per article, assigned based on prominence, sentiment. Modifiers describe the type of presence (e.g. “Peripheral Hit,” “Strategic Win”).

               * Signals — multiple per article, assigned based on narrative structure, trend signals, outlet tier, quote presence, or strategic contrast. Signals describe why the presence matters, or how the framing environment amplifies or limits impact. Some signals are article-based (e.g. quote-driven framing); others are dataset-based (e.g. sentiment decline).
These layers transform visibility into strategy. For example:
                  * A brand might be Under Fire in a Narrative Shaping article — a top-tier story that defines how others will frame the issue.

                  * It might be a Leader with a Strategic Win in a narrative that is structurally Unowned — creating a clear opportunity to claim leadership.

                  * Or it may be Off-Stage in a narrative that’s Gaining Prominence, suggesting that absence is becoming a liability.

Some signals are triggered by single article traits — like a high-impact quote or peer comparison. Others, like Strategic Fallout, emerge from trends across multiple articles and are evaluated only in aggregate.


This framework is engineered for automation — built to apply its logic consistently across thousands of articles — but its power lies in its clarity. The language is deliberately plain so that human teams can act with speed and confidence.


🟥 Absent State – Narrative Description
Absent is the most structurally distinct state in the diagnostic system. It applies when a brand is completely excluded from an article that is confirmed to be on-topic — and none of the tracked narratives appear either. This is not a matter of low prominence or marginal framing. It's a total absence from the conversation.
An entity is assigned to the Absent state when:
                     * The entity is not mentioned (Prominence = 0)

                     * All tracked narratives are absent (Prominence = 0)

                     * The topic is present and relevant

This dual absence — of both the brand and any strategically defined narrative — is analytically meaningful. It signals that the media is discussing the topic, but not in any frame the brand is currently seeking to influence or shape.
________________


🎯 Strategic Purpose of the Absent State
The goal of this state is not to simply flag missing mentions. It’s to evaluate whether:
                        * The topic itself is shifting, generating coverage outside your narrative architecture

                        * The brand is misaligned with where media attention is flowing

                        * There are structural gaps in the story universe that may require strategic intervention

________________


🧩 Modifiers for the Absent State
Each Absent-state entity is assigned one mutually exclusive modifier that describes the nature of the absence:
Modifier
	Trigger Logic
	Strategic Meaning
	Not Relevant
	Topic_Prom < 2 AND no tracked narrative present
	Weakly framed/low‑salience article — likely noise rather than a strategic signal.
	Narrative Drift
	Topic_Prom ≥ 2 AND Topic_Sent ≥ 0 AND no tracked narrative present
	On‑topic, positive/benign coverage outside your tracked frames — likely taxonomy gap or reframing.
	Untracked Negativity
	Topic_Prom ≥ 2 AND Topic_Sent < 0 AND no tracked narrative present
	Negative, meaningful coverage outside your frames — the story is running hot without your voice, creating reputational risk.
	🔍 Why Absent Matters
Absent is not a footnote. It’s a diagnostic lens on structural alignment between a brand’s positioning and the media environment. It tells us:
                           * Whether our narrative architecture matches media behavior

                           * Whether new storylines are emerging outside the defined landscape

                           * Whether absence is benign, advantageous, or strategically dangerous

📰 Sample Article
Headline: New Privacy Regulations Shift the Landscape for Tech Companies
Outlet Score: 4 (High-tier outlet)
Topic: Children’s Online Safety
Narrative Present: None (No tracked narrative matches)
Prominence of Topic: 3.5 (highly central)
Entities Mentioned: None of the tracked entities (e.g., Google, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram)
Summary:
The article explores how evolving privacy regulations, particularly COPPA updates and state-level age verification laws, are changing how tech platforms collect and manage user data. It references general concerns around child safety but does not mention specific companies or link to any of the tracked narratives such as age-appropriate design, algorithmic influence, or mental health outcomes.

🔧 Assigned Modifier: Narrative Drift


The article is clearly about the topic and treats it as central — but it does not include any of the tracked narratives. It suggests that coverage is drifting toward a subnarrative or reframing (privacy compliance) that isn’t yet modeled in the current taxonomy.
________________


🧩 Strategic Interpretation:
                              * The brand isn’t just missing — the framework itself may be misaligned with how the topic is evolving.

                              * This may signal the emergence of a new narrative or the need to refine the taxonomy to stay relevant.

                              * If the brand is doing proactive work around privacy (e.g. age assurance, data minimization), this article suggests it’s not breaking through — because the conversation is happening outside your defined frames.
________________


🟧 Off-Stage – Narrative Description (Updated)
Off-Stage applies when the topic and a tracked narrative are present, but the entity is not mentioned at all. Unlike Absent — which reflects a lack of structured framing — Off-Stage indicates that the media is actively telling a story, but the brand isn’t part of it.
This is a state of invisibility in a live narrative. The story is being told. A frame is in place. But the brand is not included — whether by omission, displacement, irrelevance, or failure to engage.
Each Off-Stage article receives exactly one modifier that defines the nature of the brand’s absence:
Modifier
	Trigger Logic
	Strategic Meaning
	Competitor-Led
	Narrative central (Prom ≥ 2.5), Sent ≥ 0, exactly 1 peer prominent (Peer Prom ≥ 2.0)
	A single rival dominates a favorable frame while you’re absent. Risk of falling behind.
	Missed Opportunity
	Narrative central (Prom ≥ 2.5), Sent ≥ 0, ≥2 peers prominent (each Prom ≥ 2.0)
	Multiple rivals are in the story, you’re not. Clients notice these gaps most.
	White Space
	Narrative central (Prom ≥ 2.5), Sent ≥ 0, no peers prominent (all peers Prom < 2.0)
	High-value story with no clear anchor — an open lane you failed to occupy.
	Guilt by Association
	Narr_Sent < 0 AND count(peers with Prom ≥ 2.0) ≥ 2
	Category‑blame story: systemic negativity implicates your cohort even if you’re unnamed.
	Cautious Schadenfreude
	Narr_Sent < 0 AND count(peers with Prom ≥ 2.0) = 1
	One peer is moderately/strongly central in a negative story; you’re adjacent to the hit.
	Reporter Agenda
	Narr_Sent < 0 AND Narr_Prom ≥ 2.5 AND count(peers with Prom ≥ 2.0) = 0
	Central negative story driven by the press (no brand anchor) — rising reputational risk while you’re invisible.
	Overlooked
	Narr_Prom < 2.5 AND count(peers with Prom ≥ 2.0) = 0 (any sentiment)
	Low‑central story with no clearly prominent peers — passive invisibility.
	✅ Off-Stage Modifier Exclusivity
Competitor-Led, Missed Opportunity, and White Space are mutually exclusive:
- Competitor-Led fires if exactly 1 peer is prominent.
- Missed Opportunity fires if ≥2 peers are prominent.
- White Space fires if no peers are prominent.
- Overlooked remains distinct as the low-centrality case (Narr Prom < 2.5).

🔧 Assigned Modifier: Cautious Schadenfreude


This is a highly negative story targeting a single prominent competitor (Instagram). YouTube is not mentioned, but it’s in the same category and could be indirectly implicated. However, because the narrative clearly centers on someone else, the strategic risk is adjacent — not direct.
________________


🧩 Optional signals:
                                 * Framing Opportunity: If this narrative is captured by Instagram, and YouTube has a potential counter-narrative, this signal would flag the strategic urgency to reenter the frame.

                                 * Ricochet Risk: If YouTube has a history of being under fire in this narrative but isn’t now, the article may carry adjacent risk even though it appears beneficial.

________________


🔍 Strategic Interpretation:
                                    * This is the story you’re not in — but maybe should be.

                                    * YouTube avoided being named in a Knockdown, but the issue affects the category. Staying quiet could be smart — or signal disengagement. If the brand has a point of differentiation or better safeguards, this is a clear opening to reset the frame while competitors take heat.

🟨 Supporting Player – Narrative Description
Supporting Player applies when an entity is present in the article — with a prominence score greater than 0 and less than 3, and with positive sentiment — but is not a central character. The entity appears in the frame without commanding it. This is the state of partial visibility: you are in the story, but not shaping its meaning.
Strategically, Supporting Player coverage sits in a middle zone — neither absent nor dominant. Sometimes this signals momentum. Other times, it reflects passive inclusion or under-leveraged visibility. The purpose of this state is to distinguish between valuable mentions, low-grade repetition, and coverage that carries little strategic weight.
Each entity in this state receives one of four mutually exclusive modifiers, based on outlet quality and sentiment:
Modifier
	Trigger Logic
	Strategic Meaning
	Strategic Signal
	Outlet Score ≥ 3 AND Sentiment ≥ 3
	You’re getting strong praise in a high-quality outlet. A sign of upward opportunity.
	Favorable Mention
	Outlet Score ≥ 3 AND Sentiment between 0.5 and 3
	You’re showing up in good coverage — but without much strategic lift.
	Low-Impact Mention
	Entity sentiment ≥0.5 in a low-tier outlet (Outlet Score <3)

	Coverage is nominally positive or neutral, but low-value — it delivers little strategic lift. Useful only as filler or procedural proof.
	These modifiers help distinguish whether partial presence is a strategic asset or simply filler content. They also create a baseline for identifying repeatable wins — or recognizing when the entity is showing up without shaping the story.
________________


🟨 Supporting Player – Example
Article Excerpt:
“In a broader look at how tech companies are approaching children’s online safety, industry leaders are taking different tacks. While Meta has launched a new parental control dashboard, YouTube continues to refine its content filters. Google has also made changes, though less visibly, and TikTok remains under scrutiny from lawmakers.”
Entity Evaluated: Google
Prominence: 1.5
Sentiment (Google-specific): 1.2
Outlet Tier: Tier 2
Outlet Score: 4
Modifier Assigned: Favorable Mention
Google appears in a quality outlet, with mildly positive sentiment, but it plays a marginal role in the article. It’s being mentioned — not ignored — but not driving the frame.
________________


Why It’s Supporting Player
                                       * Prominence is between 0 and 3 → not central to the story.

                                       * Outlet Score ≥ 3 and Sentiment between 0.5 and 2 → fits Favorable Mention.

                                       * The article is framed around a broader narrative (industry response to online safety), and Google is one of several minor players mentioned.
This kind of coverage is strategically relevant, but it’s not a breakthrough. It shows that the brand is in the conversation, but not actively shaping it — which may call for a campaign to elevate clarity or control.


________________
🟥 Under Fire – Narrative Description
Under Fire applies when a brand is present in coverage and framed negatively — regardless of how central it is to the story. This is the only state defined entirely by tone, not just visibility. It captures any article in which an entity is visible (Prominence > 0) and the tone of that visibility is negative (Sentiment < 0).
This includes a wide range of scenarios — from full-blown media attacks in national outlets to passing references in lightly critical coverage. What unites these moments is that the brand is under reputational pressure, even if it is not the protagonist.
To make this broad category actionable, the system applies six mutually exclusive modifiers that distinguish the severity and structure of the risk:
Modifier 
	Trigger Logic
	Strategic Meaning
	Narrative Shaper
	Prominence ≥ 4; Sentiment ≤ –3.0; Outlet Score = 5
	Moment likely to define how others frame the story.
	Knockdown
	Prominence ≥ 3; Sentiment ≤ –2.0; Outlet Score = 4 (Not narrative shaper)
	A front-and-center reputational attack in a high-impact outlet — the brand is explicitly framed as the problem.
	Body Blow
	Prominence ≥ 3; Sentiment ≤ –2.0; Outlet Score > 2 (Not Narrative shaper or Knockdown)
	A prominent, highly negative story in a credible regional or mid-tier outlet — painful now, with risk of being amplified.
	Sharp Jab
	Prominence ≥ 2.0; Sentiment ≤ –2.0; Outlet Score ≤ 3 (exclude by precedence: Narrative Shaper, Knockdown, and Body Blow.)
	A sharp, painful hit in a less influential setting — still damaging, but less likely to drive the wider conversation.
	Light Jab
	Prominence ≥ 2.0; Sentiment between 0 and –2.0
	Visible and critical, but without sharp or damaging attack lines — irritation more than injury.
	Collateral Damage
	Prominence < 2.0; Sentiment ≤ –2.0
	The brand is peripheral to the story but still caught in deep negativity — reputational harm by proximity.
	Peripheral Hit
	Prominence < 2.0; Sentiment between 0 and –2.0
	The brand is not central, but appears in negative framing — reputational splash damage, not direct scrutiny.
	This approach ensures that any time the brand is framed negatively — whether by being quoted out of context, mentioned alongside a scandal, or directly targeted — it is strategically surfaced and contextually diagnosed.
This state acts as the early warning system of the diagnostic model. It alerts communicators not just to the presence of criticism, but to how it’s structured, how visible it is, and how likely it is to escalate. It supports faster, sharper decisions in moments when stakes are high — or quietly rising.

                                          * Headline: “Tech Giant Criticized Over Child Safety Failures”

                                          * Outlet: The New York Times

                                          * Outlet Score: 5

                                          * Prominence for Meta: 3.2

                                          * Sentiment for Meta: –3.1

                                          * Narratives Present: Child Safety, Platform Accountability

                                          * Entity State for Meta: Under Fire

                                          * Modifier: Knockdown

Interpretation:
This is a textbook Under Fire moment for Meta. It is highly prominent in a negative story from a top-tier outlet, receiving a Knockdown modifier.

🟩 Leader – Narrative Description
Leader applies when a brand is both highly prominent (Prominence ≥ 3) and framed positively (Sentiment ≥ 0). It signals a position of strength: the brand isn’t just mentioned — it’s driving the story and doing so in a way that reinforces credibility, trust, or leadership.
This is the most advantageous state in the system. It reflects earned success in the media — often through strong storytelling, message clarity, or centrality in a strategically relevant narrative.
But not all positive coverage is equal. That’s why this state uses a four-tiered modifier system to distinguish between levels of quality and strategic value:
Narrative Setter
	Prom ≥ 4; Sent ≥ +3; Outlet Score = 5 
	The best coverage you can get. A breakthrough story that other media outlets follow. 
	Breakthrough 
	Prom ≥ 4; Sent ≥ +3; Outlet Score ≥ 4 (not Narrative Setter)
	A standout, high-impact win in a top-tier outlet. Defines the conversation and is difficult for competitors to match.
	Great Story
	Prom ≥ 3; Sent ≥ +2; Outlet Score ≥ 3; Not Breakthrough or Narrative Setter
	A strong, strategically valuable win in credible coverage — highly positive framing with clear relevance.
	Good Story
	Prom ≥ 3; ((Outlet Score ≥ 3 AND Sent ≥ +1 AND Sent < +2) OR (Outlet Score < 3 AND Sent ≥ +2)); Not Great Story or Breakthrough
	Positive coverage with strategic or reputational benefit, but limited by outlet quality or sentiment intensity. A controllable, confidence-building win.
	Routine Positive
	Prom ≥ 3; Sent ≥ 0; Not Breakthrough, Great Story, or Good Story
	Coverage that’s favorable but routine or low-impact. Often the result of expected mentions, procedural reporting, or commodity coverage without meaningful lift.
	Each article is assigned one of these four mutually exclusive modifiers. Together, they help answer:
“Is this a win worth celebrating — or just a useful mention?”
The Leader state allows communicators to distinguish between different kinds of success. It clarifies which stories represent replicable wins, which are outliers, and which are simply helpful. This structure supports better decision-making around amplification, strategy, and where to invest next.
🟢 Example
An article in The New York Times explores the use of AI to detect misinformation. The piece centers on Google’s new tools, features a quote from a senior Google executive in the second paragraph, and frames the company as setting a new industry standard. The outlet is Tier 1, the tone is highly positive, and Google’s prominence score is 4.5.
This article would be tagged with the Leader state and the Breakthrough Coverage modifier — a defining moment of earned narrative control.

✨ Understanding Signals in the Diagnostic Framework
Signals are how the system adds strategic texture to coverage.
                                             * States classify what role an entity or narrative plays in each article.

                                             * Modifiers clarify the type of presence in that role.

                                             * Conditions synthesize patterns into a strategic diagnosis.

                                             * Signals explain why it matters — surfacing momentum, entrenchment, and distribution dynamics that don’t show up in a single score.

Signals are not destinations on the diagnostic ladder. They are explanatory overlays that reveal movement, competition, structural control, and coverage dynamics.

🧩 What Signals Do
Signals answer the “so what?” questions:
                                                * Is the entity gaining ground or losing it?

                                                * Are peers consistently stronger, or weaker?

                                                * Is a narrative stable, contested, or open for capture?

                                                * Is coverage stuck in trades, siloed, or scaling into mainstream?

They don’t replace conditions — they explain why conditions harden, soften, or stall.

🔄 Where Signals Fit
Signals now live in four quadrants. Each quadrant can contribute at most one signal per entity per window.
                                                   1. Entity Momentum (Trajectory) → How the entity’s visibility and tone are moving.

                                                   2. Peer Dynamics (Competitive Positioning) → How the entity stacks up against competitors.

                                                   3. Narrative Structure (Ownership & Control) → Who owns, contests, or drives a frame.

                                                   4. Coverage Dynamics (Distribution & Venue Mix) → Where coverage resonates, and whether it can scale.

This four-lens approach makes the system holistic: motion, competition, framing, distribution.

⚖️ Signal Strength
Each signal is classified into one of three strength tiers:
                                                      * Strong → Condition-bending, named explicitly in the Executive Summary.

                                                      * Medium → Explanatory context, glossed in ES Paragraph 2.

                                                      * Weak → Suppressed unless no stronger signal fires in that quadrant (often appendix-only).

                                                         1. Quadrant Cap → 1 signal per quadrant per entity per window.

                                                         2. Suppression Order → Within each quadrant, the most specific signal wins.

                                                         3. Global Cap → Max 4 signals per entity per window (one per quadrant).

                                                         4. Placement → Strong = named; Medium = glossed; Weak = appendix-only.

🔒 Global Signal Rules (All Quadrants)
                                                            1. Quadrant cap

                                                               * Each entity may surface at most one signal per quadrant per window.

                                                               * This yields a global maximum of 4 surfaced signals per entity per window (one per quadrant).

                                                               * All signals are still recorded; suppression only applies to reporting in the Executive Summary (ES).

                                                                  2. Suppression order (within quadrants)

                                                                     * Signals are prioritized by Stage and Strength (Strong > Medium > Weak).

                                                                     * Higher-stage signals always suppress lower-stage ones.

                                                                        3. Signal strength tiers

                                                                           * Strong → Condition-bending. Always surfaced and explicitly named in ES (Paragraph 1 or 2).

                                                                           * Medium → Explanatory. Always surfaced but glossed in ES Paragraph 2.

                                                                           * Weak → Always recorded but suppressed from ES outputs unless no stronger signal fires in that quadrant. Analysts may gloss them for explanatory purposes in ES P2. Weak signals may also surface in other report sections (quadrant slides, heatmaps, appendices) to provide supporting context.

                                                                              4. Axis Rider rule (Peer Dynamics only)

                                                                                 * If a valid signal on the opposite axis (Prominence vs. Sentiment) also fires, a single rider gloss may appear in ES Paragraph 2.

                                                                                 * Rider precedence:

                                                                                    * If primary is Prominence → rider may be Comparative Risk/Gain > Negative Foil > Wedge.

                                                                                    * If primary is Sentiment → rider may be Second Fiddle only (Boxed Out would have won primary).

                                                                                       5. Narrative positives flexibility

                                                                                             6. Outlet Driver thresholds

Bottom line:
Signals make the system legible. Each quadrant yields at most one.
Strong signals headline, Medium signals explain, Weak signals contextualize.
Together, they show not just what coverage says, but how it behaves, who drives it, and whether it can scale.

🧠 Introducing Diagnostic Conditions
What they are, why they matter, and how to use them
Most media analysis systems stop at surface-level metrics like sentiment or share of voice. The Orchestra Diagnostic System goes deeper — translating raw coverage data into diagnostic conditions that reveal how a brand is truly positioned in the media landscape.
Conditions are the system’s top-line assessment of strategic health. They synthesize dozens of signals — including tone, prominence, narrative structure, and trajectory — into a plain-language summary of what’s really going on. Each condition reflects a pattern of coverage, not a single moment.
And unlike blunt labels like “positive” or “negative,” conditions capture nuanced positioning — from reputational crises to rising leadership. They account for both intensity and trajectory, as well as the structural role a brand plays in the media conversation. In short, they don’t just describe what’s happening — they explain why it matters and what to do next.
Every entity in a dataset receives one primary and (when applicable) one secondary condition. These are assigned through a structured evaluation that considers:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Volume and consistency of supporting coverage

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Severity or opportunity of the narrative position

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Narrative prominence and competitive context

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            * Strategic movement over time (trends, erosion, momentum)

This lets the system distinguish between:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * A brand under attack because it owns a toxic narrative (Toxic Ownership)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * One quietly building momentum across narratives (Emerging Leadership)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               * Or one mentioned frequently, but without strategic direction (Bystander)

Conditions apply to the full spectrum of earned coverage — from leadership wins to strategic absences. They form the foundation for executive summaries, help prioritize actions, and serve as the connective tissue between the report’s diagnostics and its strategic guidance.
In practical terms: Conditions are the voice of the system. They turn measurement into meaning — and insight into action.

🎚 Understanding the Condition Spectrum
From reputational crisis to strategic momentum — and everything in between
While each condition has a discrete definition, the system treats them as part of a structured spectrum of strategic health. This spectrum ranges from deeply negative to powerfully positive — with mixed and transitional conditions in between. Understanding the spectrum is essential not just for labeling, but for interpreting risk, opportunity, or stagnation.
➖ Negative Conditions
Capture reputational harm, narrative risk, or structural exclusion. Some reflect active attack (toxic ownership, emerging villain), while others capture erosion or vulnerability (reputational harm, negative drag, framing decay, collateral risk). These are the most urgent states and often demand defensive strategy or reputation repair.
🔁 Mixed Conditions
Capture strategic ambiguity — visibility without control, presence without impact. Examples include Passive Positivity, contrast identity, and bystander. They are neither inherently good nor bad, but often flag underperformance or muted opportunity.
➕ Positive Conditions
Capture constructive presence — from breakout moments (breakthrough), to durable positioning (trusted leader), to promising shifts (emerging leadership). These conditions signal momentum that can be amplified, protected, or strategically replicated.
🧭 Transitional Conditions
Track trajectory — how posture is changing, not just where it stands. Conditions like reputational harm, negative drag, or framing decay describe whether an entity is rising, falling, or stuck.

🧠 Diagnostic Conditions — Source of Truth 


🔴 Negative Conditions
Condition
	Trigger Logic (Windowed)
	Strategic Meaning
	Toxic Ownership
	Narrative captured (≥60% share, Entity_Prom ≥2.5) AND narrative avg Sent < 0 AND entity was Emerging Villain or Systemic Blame in ≥3 of last 6 windows
	You are the face of the problem — your brand defines the harm.
	Systemic Blame
	(Reputational Harm OR Emerging Villain) in ≥2 of last 3 windows OR ≥3 of last 6 windows AND current-window avg entity Sent ≤ −1.0
	Persistent broad blame — you are symbolically tied to a structurally negative narrative.
	Emerging Villain
	≥15% of prominent-topic articles with Entity_Prom ≥2.5 AND ≥3 High-Stakes/Body Blow modifiers in window AND avg Sent ≤ −2.0
	Negativity sharpens around you — you are becoming the villain of the story.
	Negative Drag
	≥15% of prominent-topic articles AND entity Sent flat (Δ ∈ [−0.5, +0.5]) across ≥2 windows in a negative narrative
	The narrative itself is dragging the brand downward, even without new hits. The entity is not doing enough to separate itself from a damaging frame, allowing reputational erosion by inertia.
	Lingering Hangover
	Prior crisis-type condition (Reputational Harm or worse) in last window AND current avg entity Sent ≤ −0.5 with no new High-Stakes hits
	Old damage persists even without fresh attacks.
	Reputational Harm
	≥10% of prominent-topic articles with Entity_Prom ≥2.5 AND ≥2 Under Fire/Body Blow modifiers in window AND avg entity Sent ≤ −2.0
	Moderate–severe direct criticism; episodic but material harm.
	Collateral Risk
	Entity Prom < 2.0 (peripheral). Narrative Sent < 0. Entity Sent ≥ 0 (brand itself not framed negatively). Often co-present with a peer trending toward Emerging Villain.





	The brand is pulled into negative coverage by proximity to sharper criticism of others. This is reputational harm by association — but because the brand is not the primary focus, there remains space to distance and differentiate.
	Low-Intensity Harm
	Entity Prom < 2.0 (peripheral). Narrative Sent ≥ 0 (narrative not hostile). Entity Sent mildly negative (−0.01 > Sent > −2.0). Pattern: appears in ≥15% of prominent-topic articles across ≥2 windows.


	The entity experiences a low-intensity but repeating pattern of negative framing. No single hit is severe, but the repetition erodes credibility and can harden into stronger negative conditions if left unchecked.

⚖️ Mixed Conditions
Condition
	Trigger Logic (Windowed)
	Strategic Meaning
	Polarized Framing
	≥10% of prominent-topic articles are very positive (Sent ≥ +2.5) AND ≥10% are very negative (Sent ≤ −2.5) in same window
	Coverage is sharply split between strong positive and strong negative narratives. The brand is simultaneously praised and criticized, creating reputational risk and opportunity in equal measure.
	Contrast Identity
	≥20% of co-presence articles with ΔSent ≥ ±2
	You are defined primarily in relation to peers.
	Reputational Whiplash
	Std dev(entity Sent) ≥ 1.5 OR std dev(entity Prom) ≥ 1.0 across the window
	Your role is inconsistent — oscillating between strong and weak.
	Chronic Subordination
	Entity appears as a Supporting Player in ≥20% of prominent-topic articles (Topic_Prom ≥2.5). The Supporting Player : Leader ratio is ≥5:1 in the current window.



	You are persistently visible but rarely central. This pattern signals structural weakness: others set the agenda while you remain secondary. Chronic subordination is not a neutral state — it reflects stalled momentum and limited authority. Without intervention, it cements your role as a follower rather than a leader.

🟢 Positive Conditions
Condition
	Trigger Logic (Windowed)
	Strategic Meaning
	Peripheral Presence
	≥10% of prominent-topic articles with Entity_Prom < 2.5 AND Sent > 0
	You’re included positively, but only in minor roles.
	Passive Positivity
	≥10% of prominent-topic articles (Narr_Prom ≥2.5) AND Entity_Prom ≥2.0 AND no leadership signals
	You’re visible in the story but not shaping it.
	Gaining Ground
	≥15% of prominent-topic articles, Entity_Prom ≥2.5, AND ≥1 Leader-state article (Good/Great/Breakthrough) in window
	Early traction — fragile, needs reinforcement.
	Emerging Leadership
	≥20% of prominent-topic articles across ≥2 windows, Entity_Prom ≥2.5, AND ≥2 Leader-state articles; Narrative avg Sent > 0
	Rising influence — repeated wins in favorable narratives.
	Trusted Leader
	≥20% of prominent-topic articles, Entity_Prom ≥2.5, AND ≥2 Leader-state articles across ≥2 outlets, sustained ≥2 windows; Narrative avg Sent > 0
	Recognized authority — consistent credibility.
	Narrative Ownership
	≥20% of prominent-topic articles in 1 narrative, Entity_Prom ≥2.5, ≥3 Leader-state articles, ≥60% narrative share; Narrative avg Sent > 0
	You dominate one storyline; peers orbit you.
	Category Captain
	Trusted Leader or Narrative Ownership in ≥2 narratives across ≥2 windows, all narrative Sent > 0
	Ceiling positive — you set direction for the category.

📌 Strong Signals and Condition Enforcement — Introduction
Strong signals are the only signals in the system with the power to bend or override condition assignment. They represent structural dynamics so acute (e.g., a reputational collapse, a Tier-1 media campaign, peer exclusion, or narrative capture) that they force the system to move an entity beyond what raw states and modifiers alone would produce.

How Strong Signals Work
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Condition bending: When a Strong signal fires, it can promote, demote, or cap an entity’s condition assignment for that window, regardless of other signal activity.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     * Bounded effects: Each Strong signal has explicit floors and ceilings (e.g., Fallout bottoms out at Reputational Harm, Outlet Driver tops out at Trusted Leader).

✅ Why This Matters
These rules ensure Strong signals are powerful enough to capture decisive real-world dynamics (NYT vs Facebook, Tesla emerging as the leader in EV narratives) without letting the system become unstable. They create bounded but consequential shocks: Fallout can flip you from positive to negative in one window, Driver can canonize you as a leader or a villain, but no entity can be hit by more than two Strong penalties at once.

📊 Strong Signals Enforcement Matrix
Quadrant
	Strong Signal(s)
	Condition Effect
	Floors & Ceilings
	Persistence / Notes
	Momentum (Entity Trajectory)
	Strategic Fallout
	Forces entity into a negative condition; flips positives/mixed → Reputational Harm by default; negatives advance one rung down.
	Floor: RH (Reputational Harm).  Edge case: TL may collapse to EV.
	Counts as 1 escalation window; repeated Fallout accelerates systemic blame.
	

	Strategic Uplift
	Forces entity into a positive/neutral condition; flips negatives → Passive Positivity by default; positives advance one rung up.
	Ceiling: TL (Trusted Leader).  Cannot leap to Ownership/Captain by Uplift alone.
	Counts as 1 recovery window; repeated Uplift accelerates ceiling positives if leadership signals also fire.
	

	Bad News Cycle
	Nudge down 1 rung for weaker states; strong states hold but tagged fragile.
	Floor = RH. Cannot flip polarity.
	Repeated ≥2 windows: can escalate (e.g., RH → EV).
	

	Good News Cycle
	Nudge up 1 rung for weaker states; strong states hold but tagged reinforced.
	Ceiling = EL. Cannot flip polarity.
	Repeated ≥2 windows: can escalate (e.g., GG → EL).
	Peer Dynamics
	Comparative Risk
	Enforces a one-rung gap: disadvantaged sits 1 rung below advantaged peer. Blocks leadership states.
	Floor = RH.
	Advantaged peer holds current rung. No double moves.
	

	Comparative Gain
	Mirror: explains why a peer was demoted (Risk), but does not auto-promote the advantaged entity.
	Ceiling = EL.
	Gap satisfied via Risk demotion; Gain is explanatory.
	

	Boxed Out
	Prominence twin of Risk. Enforces a one-rung gap vs peers in entrenched leadership. Blocks leadership states.
	Floor = RH; Ceiling = EL.
	If Risk + Boxed Out both fire: disadvantaged demoted 1 additional rung (RH floor).
	Narrative Structure
	Framing Cage
	Blocks access to leadership/blame positions if peer dominates structurally. Entity capped 1 rung below.
	Applies only if narrative is Healthy/Risky/High Risk and ≥30% of articles (25–35% buffer with persistence).
	Persists until cage breaks.
	

	Captured Narrative
	Grants exclusive access to leadership/blame for the captured entity; peers capped 1 rung below.
	Same narrative-state requirement as Cage.  Ceiling = TL/Ownership (positive).  Floor = EV/Systemic (negative).
	Persists until capture breaks.
	

	Hostile Frame
	Accelerates entities into harm when the narrative itself turns structurally negative.
	Applies only if narrative Sent < −1.5 and ≥30% of topic coverage has Prom ≥2.5 (25–35% buffer with persistence).
	Entities present are shortcut into Reputational Harm if Entity Sent < 0, or Collateral Risk if Entity Sent ≥ 0.
Persists until the frame softens or drops below threshold.
	Coverage Dynamics
	Outlet Driver (Enemy)
	Tier-1 adversary. Forces entity to ≥RH; if already RH, escalates to Emerging Villain.
	Floor = RH.  Ceiling = EV.
	Consecutive Enemy windows count toward systemic blame. Supersedes Cage/Captured.
	

	Outlet Driver (Champion)
	Tier-1 ally. Forces entity to ≥EL; if already EL, escalates to Trusted Leader.
	Floor = EL.  Ceiling = TL.
	Consecutive Champion windows count toward Category Captain (with structural support). Supersedes Cage/Captured.

Driver applies in all narrative states.

📌 Strategic Response Guide — How to Use This Section
The Diagnostic System doesn’t stop at labeling — it’s built to drive action. Once a Condition has been assigned, the next question is “What should we do about it?”
This section translates diagnostic findings into strategic response options. For every condition in the system — whether negative, mixed, positive, or procedural — you’ll find targeted guidance on:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         * Risks — Why this condition matters and what’s at stake if it’s ignored.

This guidance is designed for analysts and strategists, not just as an operational checklist. It complements the rulesets for automation by showing how human judgment and creativity can extend the system’s value — for example, bypassing traditional media to create owned reference points that journalists pick up later, or seeding proof points to change the narrative trajectory.

Definition:
The narrative itself is dragging the brand downward, even without new hits. The entity is not doing enough to separate itself from a damaging frame, allowing reputational erosion by inertia.

Mixed Conditions
Polarized Framing
Definition:
You have a split visibility profile — meaningful coverage that is both highly positive and highly negative, often across different outlets or narratives.
Risks:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    * Audience confusion: no clear, consistent positioning.

Appendix: Narrative Signals & Conditions in the Diagnostic Framework
Narratives are where strategy happens. Topics define the universe of coverage — but narratives define how the story is told, who shapes it, and whether the framing is viable or dangerous. Winning a narrative is often more consequential than winning a topic, because narratives set the terms of debate and determine reputational outcomes.
This system applies a dedicated diagnostic layer to narratives that parallels our entity framework. While entities are assigned states, modifiers, and conditions, narratives are assigned their own signals and conditions that reveal whether a storyline is strategically viable, contested, fading, or toxic.
Narrative analysis answers a different but equally critical question: Is this a story worth fighting in?

Narrative Conditions — top-line structural diagnoses that summarize the overall posture of the frame. Examples include Strategically Viable, Contested Battleground, Toxic Arena, and White Space Frame. These conditions describe the health of the story itself, independent of any one entity.

Narrative ownership and control (e.g., Dominant, Captured, Unowned) are expressed as signals in Quadrant 3 (Ownership & Control), not as standalone conditions. A narrative can be toxic without being captured, or viable but monopolized by a single player. Ownership overlays sharpen interpretation but do not define the structural health of the frame.
Together, narrative signals and conditions provide the stage-level view of the media environment. They help communicators answer:
